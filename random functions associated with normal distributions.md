Usually a sample is taken from a normally distributed function $N(\mu ,\sigma^2)$. We are interested in estimating the parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ or in testing conjectures about these paramters.

##### Theorem 


If $X_1 , X_2 ,\dots , X_n$ are $n$ mutually independent normal variables with means $\mu_1 , \mu_2 , \dots , \mu_n$ and variances $\sigma_{1}^{2} , \sigma_{2}^{2}, \dots , \sigma_{n}^{2}$, respectively, then the linear function $$Y = \sum_{i=1}^{n}c_i X_i$$ has the normal distribution $$N\left( \sum_{i=1}^{n}c_i \mu_i , \sum_{i=1}^{n}c_{i}^{2}\sigma_{i}^{2} \right)$$.


###### Corollary
If $X_1 , X_2 ,\dots , X_n$ are observation of a random sample of size $n$ from the normal distribution $N(\mu ,\sigma^2 )$, then the distribution of the sample mean $\overline{X} = 1/n\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ is $N(\mu , \sigma^2 /n)$
