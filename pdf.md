The probability density funciton (pdf) of X is a function that is for some continuous random variable $X$ is denoted by the derivative of the [[cdf]] more specifically $$G'(x) = g(x)$$ Where $G'(x)$ is the derivative of the [[cdf]]

Properties of the pdf are 
* $f(x) \geq 0, \quad x\in S$
* $\int_S f(x)dx = 1$
* if $(a,b)\subseteq S$ then the probability of the event $\{a < X <b \}$ is $$P(a < x < b) = \int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx$$
