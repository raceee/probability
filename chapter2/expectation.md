##### Definition 2.2-1

If $f(x)$ is the pmf of the random variable $X$ of the $\textbf{discrete type}$ with space $S$, and if the summation $$\sum_{x\in S}u(x)f(x)$$ exists, then the sum is called the $\textbf{mathematical expectation}$ of $u(X)$, and it is denoted by $E[u(X)]$. That is, $$E[u(X)] = \sum_{x\in S}u(x)f(x)$$

##### Properties of mathematical expectation
1. If $c$ is a constant, then $E(c) = c$
2. If $c$ is a constant and $u$ is a function, then $$E[cu(X)] = cE[u(X)]$$
3. If $c_1$ and $c_2$ are constants and $u_1$ and $u_2$ are functions, then $$E[c_1 u_1 (X) + c_2 u_2 (X)] = c_1 E[u_1 (X)] + c_2 E[u_2 (X)]$$
