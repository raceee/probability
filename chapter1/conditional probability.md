###### Definition
The conditional probability of an event $A$, given that event $B$ has occurred, is defined by $$P(A\vert B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$$ provided that $P(B) > 0 with is one of the [[properties of probability]]

###### Definition
The probability that two events, $A$ and $B$, both occur is given by the multiplication rule, $$P(A\cap B) = P(A)P(B\vert A)$$  provided $P(A)>0$ or by $$P(A\cap B) = P(B)P(A\vert B)$$ provided $P(B)>0$.
