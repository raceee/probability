###### Multiplication Principle:
Suppose that an experiment (or procedure) $E_1$ has $n_1$ outcomes and, for each of these possible outcomes, an experiment (procedure) $E_2$ has $n_2$ possible outcomes. Then the composite experiment (procedure) $E_1 E_2$ that consists of performing first $E_1$ and then $E_2$ has $n_1 n_2$ possible outcomes.

###### Definition
Each of the $n!$ arrangements (in a row) of $n$ different objects is called a permuation of the $n$ objects.
###### Definition
Each of the ${}_b P_r$ arrangements is called a permutations of $n$ objects taken $r$ at a time.
###### Definition
If $r$ objects are selected from a set of $n$ objects, and if the order of selection is noted, then the selected set of $r$ objects is called an ordered sample of size $r$.
###### Definition
Sampling with replacement occurs when an object is selected and then replaced before the next object is selected.
###### Definition
Sampling iwthout replacement occurs when an object is not replaced after it has been selected.
###### Definition
Each of the ${}_n C_r$ unordered subsets is called a combination of $n$ objects taken $r$ at a time, where $${}_n C_r = {n\choose r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$$
###### Definition
Each of the ${}_n C_r$ permutations of $n$ objects, $r$ of one type and $n-r$ of another type, is called a distinguishable permutation.
