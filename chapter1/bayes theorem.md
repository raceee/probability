#### Baye's Theorem
Imagine you have different colored balls in a bunch of different buckets. Then bayes' theorem is used to figure out the probability of this situation. The equation for which is 

$$P(B_k \vert A) = \frac{P(B_k )P(A\vert B_k)}{\sum_{i=1}^{m}P(B_i )P(A\vert B_i)}$$

###### Example
In a certain factor, machines I, II, and III are all producing springs of the same length. Of their production, machines I, II, and III respectively produce 2%, 1%, and 3% defective springs. Of the toatl production of spings in the factory, machine I produces 35%, machine II produces 25%, and machine III produces 40%. If one sping is selected at random from the total springs produced in a day, by the law of total proabbility ([[properties of probability]]), $P(D)$ equals, in an obvious notation. (Page 37)
