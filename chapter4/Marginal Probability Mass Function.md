Let X and Y have the joint probabiity mass function $f(x,y)$ with sapce $S$. The probability function of just X alone is derived from the [[Joint Probability Mass Function]]. This is called the marginal probability mass function of X or Y.

$$f_X (x) = \sum_y f(x,y) = P(X = x), \quad x\in S_x$$
Similarly the marginal probability mass function of Y is 

$$f_Y (y) = \sum_x f(x,y) = P(Y = y), \quad y\in S_y$$

The random variables X and Y can be [[independent or dependent]] iff, for every $x\in S_x$ and every $y\in S_Y$ $$P(X = x, Y = y) = P(X = x)P(Y = y) = f_x (x,y)f_y (x,y)$$
