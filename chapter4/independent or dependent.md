The conditions for Independence between two random discrete variables that are involved in a [[Marginal Probability Mass Function]]  are for every $x\in S_x$ and every $y\in S_Y$ $$P(X = x, Y = y) = P(X = x)P(Y = y) = f_x (x,y)f_y (x,y)$$

When we graph the probabilities in if the probabilities do not make a rectangualr shape the variables must be dependent.

Also look back at the [[properties of probability]].
