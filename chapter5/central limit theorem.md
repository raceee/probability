##### Theorem 5.6-1 Central Limit Theorem
If $\overline{X}$ is the mean of a random sample $X_1 , X_2 , \dots, X_n$ of size $n$ from a distribution with a finite mean  $\mu$ and a finite positive variance $\sigma^2$ then the distribution of $$W = \frac{\overline{X}-\mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i - n\mu}{\sqrt{n}\sigma}$$ is $N(0,1)$ in the limit as $n\rightarrow\infty$.
